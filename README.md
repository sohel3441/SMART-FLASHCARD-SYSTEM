# 🧠 Smart Flashcard System (Backend)

This is the backend for a Smart Flashcard System built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.  
Students can create flashcards without specifying a subject — the backend infers the subject automatically based on the question/answer content.  
Flashcards can then be fetched intelligently, mixing different subjects for effective revision.
